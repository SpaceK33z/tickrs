## 2026-01-13: Fixed compilation errors and failing tests

### Problem
The project had compilation errors in two files:
1. `src/config/mod.rs` - Raw string literals with `#` characters were not being parsed correctly
2. `src/models/project.rs` - Same issue with JSON test strings containing `#FF5733` color codes

Additionally, `test_config_default` was failing because `#[derive(Default)]` doesn't apply serde default functions.

### Solution
1. Replaced multi-line raw string literals (`r#"..."#`) with single-line escaped strings
2. Implemented `Default` trait manually for `Config` struct to properly use the `default_project_color()` function

### Changes Made
- `src/config/mod.rs`:
  - Changed `test_config_deserialization` to use escaped string instead of raw string
  - Added manual `impl Default for Config` to ensure `default_project_color` is applied
- `src/models/project.rs`:
  - Changed `test_project_deserialization` to use escaped JSON string
  - Changed `test_project_data_deserialization` to use escaped JSON string

### Results
- All 23 tests pass
- Project compiles successfully
- Clippy shows only expected dead_code warnings (code not yet used) and minor suggestions
